            <summary>1. What is React?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                React is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces. It allows
                developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update the UI using a declarative approach.
                React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering performance and provides tools for managing state and
                side effects in components.

            <summary>2. What are the advantages of using React?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                The advantages of React include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Component-based architecture</strong>: Components are reusable, making code more modular
                        and easier to maintain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Virtual DOM</strong>: React uses a virtual DOM to update only the parts of the UI that
                        have changed, improving performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Declarative UI</strong>: React's declarative syntax makes it easy to describe the UI,
                        improving readability and maintainability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unidirectional data flow</strong>: This simplifies the data flow and makes the
                        application easier to debug.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rich ecosystem</strong>: React has a strong ecosystem with tools like React Router,
                        Redux, and a large community for support.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </details>

            <summary>3. What are the limitations of React?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                Some limitations of React are:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>JSX learning curve</strong>: While JSX is powerful, it may be difficult for beginners to
                        grasp initially.</li>
                    <li><strong>SEO challenges</strong>: React is a client-side rendering library, which can present SEO
                        challenges, though solutions like server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generators can
                        address this.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance issues with large apps</strong>: React's performance may degrade if not
                        properly optimized in very large applications, especially with a lot of re-renders.</li>
                    <li><strong>Frequent updates</strong>: React is frequently updated, and keeping up with new features
                        and best practices may be challenging.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>4. What is useState() in React?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                The <code>useState()</code> hook is a built-in hook in React that allows you to add state to functional
                components. It returns an array with two values: the current state value and a function to update it.
                <pre><code class="language-java">
            import { useState } from 'react';

            const Counter = () =&gt; {
                const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

                return (
                    &lt;div&gt;
                        Count: {count}
                        &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(count + 1)}&gt;Increment&lt;/button&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                );
            };
        </code></pre>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>5. What are keys in React?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                Keys in React are unique identifiers used to track elements in a list of components. They help React
                efficiently update the user interface when the list changes. Keys are necessary when rendering lists of
                elements to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
                <pre><code class="language-java">
            const listItems = items.map(item =&gt; (
                &lt;li key={item.id}&gt;{item.name}&lt;/li&gt;
            ));
        </code></pre>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>6. What is JSX?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within
                JavaScript. JSX is then compiled to JavaScript at runtime. It makes it easier to define React components
                and their structure.
                <pre><code class="language-java">
            const element = &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;;
        </code></pre>
            </div>

        <details>
            <summary>7. What are the differences between functional and class components?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                The differences between functional and class components are:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Syntax:</strong> Class components use ES6 class syntax, while functional components use
                        plain JavaScript functions.</li>
                    <li><strong>State and lifecycle methods:</strong> Class components can hold state and have lifecycle
                        methods, while functional components need hooks (e.g., <code>useState</code>,
                        <code>useEffect</code>) to manage state and side effects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Functional components are generally simpler and more lightweight,
                        but class components may be more appropriate for complex logic.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>8. What is the virtual DOM? How does React use the virtual DOM to render the UI?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                The virtual DOM (VDOM) is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM elements. React uses the virtual
                DOM to optimize rendering by first updating the virtual DOM and then performing a diffing algorithm to
                compare it with the real DOM. Only the parts of the UI that have changed are re-rendered, improving
                performance.
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>9. What are the differences between controlled and uncontrolled components?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                The differences between controlled and uncontrolled components are:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Controlled components:</strong> The form element's value is controlled by React state.
                        Every change to the form value is handled by the component.
                        <pre><code class="language-java">
                const [value, setValue] = useState('');

                return &lt;input value={value} onChange={(e) =&gt; setValue(e.target.value)} /&gt;
            </code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Uncontrolled components:</strong> The form element's value is not controlled by React
                        state, and you use refs to get the value when needed.
                        <pre><code class="language-java">
                const inputRef = useRef();

                const handleSubmit = () =&gt; {
                    alert(inputRef.current.value);
                };

                return &lt;input ref={inputRef} /&gt;
            </code></pre>
                    </li>

        <details>
            <summary>10. What are props in React?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                Props (short for properties) are read-only data passed from a parent component to a child component.
                They allow you to pass dynamic values to child components and configure them. Props are immutable within
                the child component.
                <pre><code class="language-java">
            const Welcome = ({ name }) =&gt; &lt;div&gt;Hello, {name}!&lt;/div&gt;;

            const App = () =&gt; {
                return &lt;Welcome name="Alice" /&gt;
            };
        </code></pre>

        <details>
            <summary>11. Explain React state and props.</summary>
            <div class="content">
                - <strong>State:</strong> State refers to data that changes over time and is specific to a component. It
                can be updated using the <code>useState</code> hook or <code>this.setState()</code> in class components.
                - <strong>Props:</strong> Props are passed from a parent component to a child component. They are
                immutable in the child and are used for communication between components.

            <summary>12. Explain about types of side effects in React component.</summary>
            <div class="content">
                Types of side effects in React include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data fetching</strong>: Making network requests to load data.</li>
                    <li><strong>DOM manipulation</strong>: Interacting with the DOM directly outside of React.</li>
                    <li><strong>Event listeners</strong>: Adding or removing event listeners.</li>
                    <li><strong>Timers</strong>: Setting intervals or timeouts.</li>
                </ul>
                The <code>useEffect</code> hook is commonly used to handle side effects in functional components.

            <summary>13. What is prop drilling in React?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                Prop drilling refers to the process of passing props from a parent component to deeply nested child
                components. This can lead to cumbersome and difficult-to-maintain code, especially in large
                applications.

        <details>
            <summary>14. What are error boundaries?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component
                tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the component tree.
                <pre><code class="language-java">
            class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
                constructor(props) {

            <summary>15. What is React Hooks?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                React Hooks are functions that let you use React features like state and lifecycle methods in functional
                components. Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 to make it possible to use features like state, side
                effects, refs, and context without writing class components.

            <summary>16. Explain React Hooks.</summary>
            <div class="content">
                React Hooks provide a way to use state and other React features in functional components:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>useState</code>: For managing state in functional components.</li>
                    <li><code>useEffect</code>: For handling side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually
                        manipulating the DOM.</li>
                    <li><code>useRef</code>: For accessing and interacting with DOM elements or keeping a mutable
                        reference.</li>
                    <li><code>useContext</code>: For consuming context in functional components.</li>

            <div class="content">
                The rules for using React hooks are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Hooks should be called at the top level of a component (not inside loops, conditions, or nested
                        functions).</li>
                    <li>Hooks should only be called from React function components or custom hooks.</li>

        <details>
            <summary>18. What is the use of useEffect React Hooks?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                The <code>useEffect</code> hook allows you to perform side effects in function components, such as
                fetching data, updating the DOM, or subscribing to events. It is called after the component renders and
                can be configured to run on specific state or prop changes.
                <pre><code class="language-java">
            useEffect(() =&gt; {
                fetchData();
            }, [data]);

        <details>
            <summary>19. Why do React Hooks make use of refs?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                React Hooks use <code>refs</code> (via <code>useRef</code>) to access and modify the DOM directly or to
                store mutable values that do not trigger re-renders. They can be used for things like focusing an input
                element or storing the previous state value.
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>20. What are Custom Hooks?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                Custom Hooks are user-defined functions that allow you to extract reusable logic from functional
                components. They enable you to share stateful logic between components without changing the component
                hierarchy.
                <pre><code class="language-java">
            function useCounter(initialValue = 0) {
                const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);

                return { count, increment: () =&gt; setCount(count + 1) };
            }
